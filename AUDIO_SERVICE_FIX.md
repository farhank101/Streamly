# Audio Service Fix Documentation

## Issue Resolution

### Problem
The app was experiencing audio service initialization errors:
- `Cannot read property 'requestPermissionsAsync' of undefined`
- `Audio service not initialized`
- `No track loaded`

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by using `expo-audio` which has a different API than `expo-av`. The `expo-audio` package doesn't have the `requestPermissionsAsync` method that our audio service was trying to use.

### Solution
1. **Reverted to `expo-av`**: Switched back to `expo-av` which has the complete API we need
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
3. **Better Logging**: Added detailed console logging for debugging
4. **Test URLs**: Using working test URLs for development

## Expo-AV Deprecation Warning

### Warning Message
```
[expo-av]: Expo AV has been deprecated and will be removed in SDK 54. Use the `expo-audio` and `expo-video` packages to replace the required functionality.
```

### Current Status
- **Using**: `expo-av` (deprecated but functional)
- **Reason**: `expo-audio` doesn't have the same API surface as `expo-av`
- **Plan**: Will migrate to `expo-audio` when it becomes more stable and feature-complete

### Migration Strategy
1. **Short-term**: Continue using `expo-av` for stability
2. **Medium-term**: Monitor `expo-audio` development
3. **Long-term**: Migrate when `expo-audio` has feature parity

3. **Check console logs** for detailed debugging information
4. **Verify audio plays** using test URLs
5. **Test navigation** to track detail pages

### Expected Console Output
```
üîß Initializing audio service...
üì± Audio permission status: granted
‚úÖ Audio service initialized successfully
üéµ Loading track: [Track Title]
üîó Getting stream URL for track: youtube
üîó Using mock stream URL for development: [URL]
‚úÖ Loaded track: [Track Title]
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting playback...

2. **Audio Quality**: Support for different audio qualities
3. **Offline Support**: Cache audio for offline playback
4. **Playlist Management**: Better queue and playlist handling
5. **Audio Effects**: Equalizer and audio effects

### Migration to expo-audio
When `expo-audio` becomes more stable:
1. Update imports from `expo-av` to `expo-audio`
2. Adjust API calls to match new interface
3. Test all audio functionality
4. Update documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Denied**: Check device audio permissions
2. **Network Issues**: Verify internet connection for streaming
3. **Audio Not Playing**: Check device volume and audio settings
4. **Initialization Failures**: Check console for detailed error messages

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Test audio service
audioService.testAudio();

// Manual initialization
audioService.manualInitialize();

// Check current state
console.log(audioService.getState());
```
